# thunk_gen

This is a generator for C and assembler thunks.
It is used to build the following software:
- [djdev64](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev)
- [comcom64](https://github.com/dosemu2/comcom64)
- [fdpp](https://github.com/dosemu2/fdpp)

It is likely not interesting for you unless you want to compile some
16bit or 32bit DOS code for 64-bits execution.
